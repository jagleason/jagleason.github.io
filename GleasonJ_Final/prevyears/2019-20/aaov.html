    <h3 class="showtext">AN ARMY OF VOICES (individual stories) and THE CLINIC by WILL BRUMLEY</h3>
    <h4 class="showtext">DIRECTED BY HANNAH FATOOL and MCKENNA GRAMZAY</h4>
    <p>An Army of Voices is an original piece centering on the experiences of UNC students that have 
        been oppressed because of their gender identity or gender expression. What does that MEAN? 
        What it means, is that we are creating an Unfiltered, Unabridged, Unashamed expression and 
        celebration of gender. This piece will be born from both from existing materials that resonate 
        with us, as well as from the experiences of the cast, crew, and UNC student community.
        <br>The Clinic focuses on the struggles of the employees of a womenâ€™s reproductive health clinic 
        in Wichita, Kansas. As these women fight for the health and safety of the patients they treat, 
        they are harassed, they are assaulted, and they are terrorized. Rather than allowing oppressive 
        forces to shut them down, they push forward, propelled both by the strength of their cause and 
        the power that they find in one another. The Clinic will be a staged reading.
        <br>Catch An Army of Voices at 7PM on January 30th or February 2nd, and catch The Clinic at 7PM on
        February 1 or 3PM on February 2!
