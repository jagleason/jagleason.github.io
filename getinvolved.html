    <h4 class="involvedtext">Auditions</h4>
        <p class="involvedtext">
            Join us in auditioning for our upcoming staged reading of “The Long Way Around,” 
            a jukebox musical featuring music from The Chicks written by current UNC student, 
            Eliana Newkirk!
        </p>
        <p class="involvedtext">
            This musical takes different Chicks songs to tell the story 
            of “Goodbye Earl,” in which we follow two best friends and their crazy life 
            journeys.
        </p>
        <p class="involvedtext">
            For auditions, we ask that you prepare one contemporary 
            monologue and one 16-32 bar cut of a song (can be musical theatre, country, 
            pop, etc.). We will meet once before the semester and then have two weeks of 
            rehearsals in January, so if you’re looking for something fun to do with low 
            time commitment, this is the show for you!
        </p>

    <h4 class="involvedtext">Finding a Monologue</h4>
        <p class="involvedtext">
            Having trouble finding a monologue? Whether this is your first time 
            finding a monologue to audition with or your fiftieth, we know and empathize 
            with how difficult it can be to find a monologue that you feel confident and 
            comfortable with.
        </p>
        <p class="involvedtext">
            Start by reading the script, which can generally be accessed through the 
            audition form, to decide what style your monologue should be in. While using 
            a comedic monologue for a drama, or a dramatic monologue for a comedy, is 
            definitely MORE than okay, playing into themes you've identified both in the 
            text as a whole, and especially with the character you'll be auditioning for, 
            never hurts. Please note that when we produce student-written works, a script 
            may not be available for you to peruse at the time of auditioning, but information 
            about the show can be found in its place. If this information is missing, please 
            let us know by emailing us at <a class="involvedtext" href="mailto:companycarolinainfo@gmail.com">
            companycarolinainfo@gmail.com</a>
        </p>
        <p class="involvedtext">
            Next, try to remember if there are any shows you've already been in (if applicable) 
            what would have a suitable monologue. Using shows you've already been a part of 
            can be a great jumping off point, since you're likely already intimately familiar 
            with the subject of the dialogue, even if you didn't play that particular character.
        </p>
        <p class="involvedtext">
            If you can't think of a monologue or show you already know that fits the bill, try 
            checking out websites like <a class="involvedtext" href="http://www.monologuearchive.com/">
            Monologue Archive</a>, <a class="involvedtext" href="https://stageagent.com/monologues">

    <h4 class="involvedtext">Applications</h4>
        <p class="involvedtext">
            “The Long Way Around” will be a staged reading in the downstairs area of Linda’s Bar and Grill, 
            meaning we will unfortunately not be needing any technicians or designers for this production, 
            and all other production staff roles have been filled.
        </p>
        <p class="involvedtext">
            Stay tuned for upcoming information about our spring semester—we’re sure to have lots 
            of opportunities coming up!
        </p>
    <h4 class="involvedtext">Preparing Your Resume/Portfolio</h4>
        <p class="involvedtext">
            While experience isn’t strictly necessary, we ask for a full resume and portfolio, if you have 
            one, so that we can choose the best fit for the production and our board. There are some semesters 
            or projects where we are able to take on and train people new to the roles they are applying for, 
            and some semesters or projects where we are not able to do so.
        </p>
        <p class="involvedtext">
            Please DON’T stress about whether or not your resume or portfolio looks “perfect”—a link to a Google 
            Drive folder means just as much to us as a fully organized website! If you have any questions, please 
            don't hesitate to reach out to our Technical Director, <a class="involvedtext" href="mailto:jgleason@Live.unc.edu">
            Jessie Gleason</a> or our main email at <a class="involvedtext" href="mailto:companycarolinainfo@gmail.com">
